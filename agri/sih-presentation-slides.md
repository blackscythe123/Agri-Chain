## Slide 2: Problem Statement & Solution Overview

### **The Agricultural Crisis We're Solving**

**Current Problems:**
- 🚫 **Middleman Exploitation:** 60-80% of value chain profits captured by intermediaries
- 🔍 **Lack of Transparency:** Consumers can't verify product authenticity
- 💸 **Payment Delays:** Farmers wait 30-45 days for payments
- 🚨 **Food Safety Issues:** No reliable source tracking for contamination

**Our Solution:**
- **Village-Level Verification Centers** - Leverage existing CSC network (5.89 lakh centers)
- **Sample-Based Quality Assessment** - 1kg sample represents entire 50 quintal batch
- **Multi-Stage Supply Chain Tracking** - Real-time updates from farm to consumer
- **IPFS + Blockchain Optimization** - 70% gas cost reduction through hybrid architecture

## Slide 3: Technical Architecture & Innovation

### **Hybrid Blockchain Architecture for Agricultural Scale**

**Technology Stack:**
| Layer | Technology | Why Chosen | Cost Impact |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React + PWA + TypeScript | Offline capability, mobile-first | Works on ₹8,000 smartphones |
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum + Arbitrum Layer 2 | 99% cost reduction vs mainnet | ₹15 per batch vs ₹8,000 |
| **Storage** | IPFS + On-chain pointers | Unlimited data, fixed costs | 70% gas savings |
| **Verification** | CSC Network Integration | Existing infrastructure | Zero setup costs |

**Gas Optimization Innovation:**
- **On-Chain:** Only critical data (112 bytes vs 1000+ bytes)
- **Off-Chain:** Complete farmer/crop details in IPFS
- **Result:** From ₹8,000 per batch to ₹17 per batch (99.8% reduction!)
